# OSDP Bench #
Tool for configuring and troubleshooting OSDP devices.

Phyisical access to spaces is typically granted using readers and badges. The readers are usually low powered end point devices that depends on a control panel to determine if the card credential is authroized to gain access. The communication between the reader and control panel is done via the Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP). Current access control panels can lack good tools to manage their connected OSDP devices. The goal of this project is to fill this gap with the necessary tools needed for technicians who are working with OSDP.

Core functionality is under an open source license to help increase the adoption rate of OSDP. A fully functional OSDP Bench tool can be compiled under this license at no cost. We encourage OSDP hardware vendors to utilize this project to accelerate the development of thier own OSDP releated tools.
